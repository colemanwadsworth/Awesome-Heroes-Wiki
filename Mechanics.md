# Game instructions  

   The objective of the game is to build your character as strong as possible and complete 10 individual levels of gameplay. Each level has a different set of criteria for completion and must be played accordingly to win. However it takes a team of characters (2-5) to beat each level. Each character has a different class and can be played by a different person, however one person may control multiple characters. Each class has a different set of stats, equipment, spells, and abilities and fills a different role in the game
