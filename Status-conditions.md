XX Status conditions  
A status condition may be inflicted by an ability, spell, trap, item, or event and will always have negative effects on the subject, when checking for a status condition an amount of dice is rolled based on the trigger causing it. Then the victim checks the appropriate stat, divides it by 4 and if the number is higher than the skulls rolled than the check is successful and the victim is not afflicted, but if it is lower than the skulls rolled than the affliction is successful.
