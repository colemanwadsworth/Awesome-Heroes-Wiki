A turn consists of an action (attacking, switching weapons or casting an active spell), which can come before, after, or in the middle of movement, and an infinite amount of passive actions (casting a passive spell or using a potion)

## Attacking  

When attacking an opponent you roll a certain amount of combat dice depending on your weapon and skill. Different classes equip certain kinds of weapons which each have there own bonuses and drawbacks

Swords) +1 against axes, -1 against spears  
Axes) +1 against spears, -1 against swords  
Spears)+1 against swords, -1 against axes  
Bows) +1 against flying, -1 against knives  
Knives) +1 against bows, -1 against flying  
Staffs) +1 against tooth and claw, -1 against swords, -1 against spears, -1 against axes

In order to calculate exactly how many combat dice you may roll for your attack, you start with the base amount (determined by your weapon), and then you add or subtract from that number based on the difference of your skill and your targets dexterity.  

For magical attacks use the base amount determined by the spell, and then add or subtract from that number based on the difference of your wisdom and your targets dexterity instead of skill  

Skill to dexterity difference|	Dice modifier
---|---
7-10 higher|	+3
4-6 higher|	+2
1-3 higher|	+1
Equal	|=
1-3 lower	|-1
4-6 lower|	-2
7-10 lower|	-3

### Damage  

The damage your attack deals is equal to the amount of skulls you roll, if the attack is magical the damage is direct, however if the attack is physical then the opponent may roll for defense (damage may be reduced by magical or physical defense) 


## Defending  

When defending you roll a certain amount of combat dice depending on your armor and your strength, different classes can equip different kinds of armor that each have bonuses and drawbacks  

In order to calculate the amount of defense dice you roll, one uses a very similar formula to attacking however uses the base number from their armor instead of their weapon and use the difference of your strength to your attackers skill as opposed to the skill to dexterity difference.  

Strength to skill difference	|Dice modifier
---|---
7-10 higher	|+3
4-6 higher|	+2
1-3 higher	|+1
Equal|	=
1-3 lower|	-1
4-6 lower|	-2
7-10 lower	|-3

### Damage  

The damage you take from a physical attack is equal to the amount of skulls your attacker rolled minus the amount of shields you roll on your defense roll 
(-physical defense) The damage you take from a magical attack is equal to the amount of skulls your attacker rolled (-magic defense)  

Occasionally you will be hit by a status condition
