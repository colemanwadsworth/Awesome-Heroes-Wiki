## Movement  
A turn consists of an action (attacking, switching weapons or casting an active spell), which can come before, after, or in the middle of movement, and an infinite amount of passive actions (casting a passive spell or using a potion)
For movement, use the number calculated for the Movement stat and apply it to the terrain type you are traversing. When moving up in height count the side of each tile as a space, however unless otherwise specified, a character may not scale heights of 3 tiles or more

**Floor**- counts as 1
	
**Grass**- counts as 1 
	
**Brush**- counts as 1 but entering brush reduces total mov by 1
	
**Sand**- counts as 1 but entering sand reduces total mov by 1
	
(Quick-sand)- appears and acts as sand but requires a d20 roll, if the roll is failed you may get stuck or fall down to lower areas

**Mountain**- counts as 2
	
**Snow**- counts as 2
	
**Ice**- counts as 2 but when crossing an ice tile you must roll a certain number or higher on a d20 or the ice breaks revealing water and ending movement. (2 for no armor, 4 for hides, 6 for robes, 8 for light armor, 10 for heavy armor, or 12 for the golem)  An action can be taken to break an adjacent ice tile (if traveling from a water, bog or lava tile onto an ice tile one must roll an 11 or higher on a d20 or the turn is over)

**Water**- counts as 1 but ends movement, moving from water tiles into either Water, Bog or lava tiles costs 2
	
(Deep water)- appears and acts as water but requires a d20 roll, a failed roll will result in drowning and death

**Bog**- counts as 1 but ends movement, moving from a Bog tile onto either a Bog, Lava, or Water tile costs 2, if turn is started in bog you must roll a certain number or higher on a d20 in order to move. (2 for no armor, 4 for hides, 6 for robes, 8 for light armor, 10 for heavy armor, or 12 for the golem)  
	
**Lava**- counts as 1 but ends movement, moving from a lava tile onto a lava water, or bog tile costs 2,  deals 2 damage when stepped on
